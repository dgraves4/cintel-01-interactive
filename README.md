# DG's PyShiny App with Plot - Continuous Intelligence Project 1

This repository contains a Python Shiny app that generates and visualizes random data distribution using various plots such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

## Overview

The Python Shiny app is built using the Shiny library, matplotlib, and numpy. It allows users to interactively adjust parameters and visualize the distribution of random data.

## Features

- Histogram: Displays the distribution of random data in a histogram format.
- Scatter Plot: Shows the random data distribution in a scatter plot.
- Heatmap: Visualizes the density of random data points in a 2D space using a heatmap.

## Usage

1. Open Shiny Playground in your web browser to access the Python Shiny app.
2. In the Shiny Playground, you'll see the code editor on the left side and the app preview on the right side.
3. Copy the code provided in this repository (app.py) and paste it into the code editor in the Shiny Playground.
4. Click on the "Run" button in the Shiny Playground to execute the code and launch the Shiny app.
5. Once the app is running, you can interact with it using the input sliders and other controls provided in the app interface.

## Dependencies

- Shiny: A Python library for building interactive web applications.
- matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- numpy: A library for numerical computing in Python.
